          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>

          <li>steps are: First type "git status" to see status. Second if not on the main branch, run "git checkout main" to switch to the main branch. Third create a new feature branch for the topic by entering "git checkout -b feature/add-code" and type "git status" again. Fourth add the starter code to the current working branch by typing "git add -A". Fifth enter "git commit -m "add starter code" , Sixth, then pull the remote main branch into the the local main branch by running "git pull origin main", now the local and remote main branches are in sync. Last type "git push origin feature/add-code" to create a remote branch in GitHub.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>cd 
          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>README files are used to pass along useful information to anyone who visits the reporsitory on GitHub</li>
          <li>git add -A: will add modifications in the current branch to the staging area. The staging area informs Git that changes will be added in the next commit</li>
          <li>git commit -m "add starter code", make sure to add in quotation marks for the message</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: used to push changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch, as seen in GitHub, there will now be a remote feature/starter-code branch</li>
          <li>git checkout main: updates the local main branch and navigates to the main branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b feature/starter-code: The feature/starter-code is the name of the new branch. We have added the prefix, feature, to indicate that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that alllows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The "const" keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. It essentially "locks down" what that variable will be, and once we declare it, we can never reassign it. When writing JavaScript, we always want to start by declaring variables using const.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Each item is assigned an index according to the order in which it is stored in the array, for example const shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];
            console.log(shapes[0,1,2,3]);</li>
          <li>If we had an array that contained 100 or even 1,000 items, the most efficient way to do this is to use loops, of which there are several types. A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the following line of code, for example let x = 0</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code, for example x is less than sign shapes.length; length is used to account for all the variables in the array.</li>
          <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1.</li>
          <li>A for loop starts with—you guessed it—for. So far, our for loop looks like the following code: for(let x = 0; x is less than sign shapes.length; x++) {
            console.log(shapes[x]);
           }
           </li>
           <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
           <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. </li>
