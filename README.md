# Prework Study Guide Webpage for HTML, CSS, Git, & JavaScript

## Description

This Study Guide was created for boot camp students who learned about the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaSript throughout the pre-course work. It can be used as a good reference for boot camp students to know what is included in each language and for when components of the languages are forgotten or confusing. This Study Guide was created to help boot camp students have visual notes about the languages, rather than trying to remember everything themselves. This Study Guide will be useful for boot camp students when backtracking their work while using these languages.

## Usage

To utilize this Study Guide, a boot camp student can review the notes written in each of the 4 languages on the website. If a boot camp student is unsure of what to review/study first, then they can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing down on Command+Option+I on (MacOs) or Control+Shift+I on (Windows) and a console panel will open either on the side or below of the webpage in the browser. Within that console panel, there will be the 4 languages that were learned throughout the pre-course work and it will give a proprosal on which language should be reviewed first.
